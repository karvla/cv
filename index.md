## Education

`2018 - 2021`
__MSc in Applied Physics at Lund University__

In my [master's thesis](https://github.com/karvla/histosnet) I used machine learning to predict the outcomes of patients diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer.

`2014  - 2018`
__BSc in Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering at Link√∂ping University__

Also did one semester of Biomedical Engineering at Link√∂ping University.

## Publications

`2022`
__Design of experiments to investigate multi-additive cellulose nanocrystal films__

Contributed to statistical analysis and the machine learning models. [Here's the paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2022.988600).

## Experiences

`2022 - now`
__Software Engineer__, itACiH 

Currently I'm a Software Engineer at itACiH where I help build a real-time application using web- and mobile-technologies such as Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Backbone, React, SQL, Git, and Gitlab CD/CI.

`2021 - 2022`
__Software Engineer__, CellaVision

At CellaVision I developed desktop-applications using .NET and C++/C#. I also trained and tuned deep learning models using Python with TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.


`2018 - 2019`
__Project Manager of Team Lund__, iGEM Competition

We earned a gold medal in [the international sythetic biology competition](https://igem.org/) for engineering a proof-of-concept probiotic to help the body get rid of toxic metals. Here's our [work](https://2019.igem.org/Team:Lund).

`2018`
__1st place in Robot Competition__, Link√∂ping

At Link√∂ping University many engineering students participate in an annual robot competition as a part of their bachelor project. My team won our category by building a robot that could navigate a maze in the shortest time.

`2017 - 2018`
__Software Engineer__, REXUS/BEXUS programme

I helped develop and integrate the software used in a [science experiment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337914988_Investigation_of_cosmic_ray_induced_defects_in_CIGS_solar_cells) for studying flexible solar cells on a high-altitude balloon at Esrange Space Center in Kiruna.


## Other stuff

`2014` __Instant camera project__

I once designed and build a cute camera that prints straight to receipt-paper. I'm still pretty proud of it. [Check it out!](https://youtu.be/iE71ovo4mns)

`2017 - 2018` __Team leader__, Costumes and Makeup - Link√∂pings Studentspex
